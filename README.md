## Project Motivation
Forecasting is crucial for organizing marketing campaigns. What location or age group is needed to put more emphasis, to what type of offer the population will respond better, and how much will the earnings will be are some of the problems that Marketing needs to face.

For all these tasks a prediction model is indispensable. In this respect, well-known is the Random Forest model and its forecasting capacity; so using a mimic data set of Starbucks users, this model was implemented and tuned to help Starbucks know how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type.
