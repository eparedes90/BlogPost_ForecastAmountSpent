# ForecastingAmountSpent

## Project Motivation
With the use of the Random Forest Model, this project aims to predict how much will someone spend based on demographics and offer type.

Forecasting is crucial for organizing marketing campaigns; therefore, it is worthy of elaborating a prediction model.

Well-known is the Random Forest model and its forecasting capacity; so using a mimic data set of Starbucks users, this model was implemented and tuned to help Starbucks know how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type.

A blog with the explanation of each of the steps can be found in the following link: https://medium.com/@eparedes90/analysis-steps-that-you-should-make-when-forecasting-with-linear-regression-and-random-forest-c457ea1734c1
